# Nuxeo Drive Server

Addon needed for [Nuxeo Drive](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-drive) to work against a Nuxeo Platform instance.

## Building

Using maven 2.2.1, from root folder:

    $ mvn clean install

Then copy the built jars \*\*/target/nuxeo-\*-SNAPSHOT.jar into the nxserver/bundles directory of your Nuxeo instance.

You should then have the 'Nuxeo Drive' tab in your Home allowing you to download the Nuxeo Drive client for your favorite OS :-)
