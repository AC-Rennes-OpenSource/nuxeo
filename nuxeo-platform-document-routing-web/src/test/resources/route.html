    traverse the route to get a data structure that represent the folders with link from each step or empty folder to its parents
    traverse the data structure to mark the younger son of each folder

    compute the max number folder depth, empty folder count as a step => $mxd
    compute the number of steps (empty folder counts as a step) => $mxs
    Create a data array [$mxd +1 , $mxs]
    For a: 0 -> $mxs   // this is for each row <tr></tr>
      For b: 0 -> $ $mxd // this is for each column, for step or empty folder this is the final <td>
                         //                          for entry first column that have folder this is a nothing <td> with a colspan
                         //                          for non empty folder that are younger son, this is a <td> with rowspan information
                         //                          for non empty folder, non younger son, this is nothing
        put stepa in [a, $mxd +1]
        $prta is the nubmer of parent for step a: put N in all value in [a, $mxd -> $mxd - $prta]
        for each value from 0 => $prta: if parent is younger sun, put folder in [a, $prta]
                                        otherwise put A in [a, $prta]
      We have a group of at most $mxd column. There are in this order:
      - a group of cells representing folder. Each cell has a rowspan
    the size of the total number of steps or empty folder in it and
    its children. This group can be empty if the line correspond to a
    step contained directly in the route (see first 2 lines of the
    following table)
      - a group of empty cells. It is there so the cell with contents
    are all aligned. The number of folder cell + number of empty cell
    == $mxd. So the number of empty cell depends of the depts of the
    step of the line. (first line has 3 empty, marked nothing, 5th
    line has no empty cell).
     
      When we have:
      - the ordered list of steps or empty folder
      - for each step, the parent folder if this step is the first child of
      this folder, and the parent of this folder if this is the first
      child and so on
      - for each step the depth of folder.

      To create the table we, for each step:
      - add a <tr>
      - for each parent folder referenced in the step, add a <td colspan=""> </td> with
      colspan value the total number of steps or empty folder
      - add ($mxd - steps deph number of folder) <td>Nothing</td> with colspan
