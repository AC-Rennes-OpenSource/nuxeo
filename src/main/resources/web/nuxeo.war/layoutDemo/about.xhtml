    <h3>About this site</h3>
  
    <div class="mainContent">
    
      <div>
        The idea of this application came with
        <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/studio" target="_blank">Studio integration</a>,
        as widget types configuration needed to be made user friendly by:
        <ul>
          <li>
            providing a library of available widget types, taking care of
            the widget accepted field type (String, Boolean, Integer....);
          </li>
          <li>
            making it possible to set the widget properties using a form;
          </li>
          <li>
            making it possible to preview the resulting widget.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br />

      <div>
        So the widget type definition was improved to hold configuration
        instructions (title, description, definition of field types that match
        the widget type...).
      </div>
      <br />

      <div>
        To describe the available properties depending on the mode, as well as
        the form to display them, layouts were the natural choice. So the widget
        type definition was modified to accept standard layout definitions, with
        widgets using the property name as a field.  
      </div>
      <br />

      <div>
        Using this way of describing a widget type is also a good maintenance tool:
        the information is kept in XML format, accepting HTML rendering for the
        description. It can be used directly to generate pages like the
        reference page or preview forms on this showcase application (using the
        standard JSF implementation of layouts).
        <br />
        It can also be exported in JSON format for Nuxeo Studio, as it accepts
        widget types as JSON contributions and uses them to fill its registries.
        A specific GWT implementation of layouts has been implemented for this
        purpose. 
      </div>
      <br />

      <div>
        A webengine application has also been added to the default Nuxeo platform
        (since version 5.4.2) so that you can get the list of available widget types
        on your Nuxeo instance, as well as some configuration details when they have
        been filled. This application is visible at http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/layout.
        <br />
        These pages do not show the widget properties as there is no Freemarker
        implementation of layouts - yet ;-).
      </div>
