TODO
====

- Objects without a "file" property should be mapped to a file of zero length.

- Create a Response wrapper that sloses the core session when the response has
  been sent and commits/rollbacks the transaction ?

- Or add a try/finally to the RootResource?

- Use nuxeo.runtime.transaction.TransactionHelper (startTra...
  setTransactionRollbackOnly...) & remove the request-controller-contrib.
